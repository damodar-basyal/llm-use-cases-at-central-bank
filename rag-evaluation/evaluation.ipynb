      "{'title': '# CHAPTER – II: GENERAL CONTROLS', 'content': \"Governance and Management of Security Risks\\n\\n4 REs shall formulate a policy for digital payment products and services with the approval of their Board. The contours of the policy, while discussing the parameters of any “new product” including its alignment with the overall business strategy and inherent risk of the product, risk management/ mitigation measures, compliance with regulatory instructions, customer experience, etc., should explicitly discuss about payment security requirements from Functionality, Security and Performance (FSP) angles such as:\\n\\na) Necessary controls to protect the confidentiality of customer data and integrity of data and processes associated with the digital product/ services offered;\\n\\nb) Availability of requisite infrastructure e.g. human resources, technology, etc. with necessary back up;\\n\\nc) Assurance that the payment product is built in a secure manner offering robust performance ensuring safety, consistency and rolled out after necessary testing for achieving desired FSP;\\n\\nd) Capacity building and expansion with scalability (to meet the growth for efficient transaction processing);\\n\\ne) Minimal customer service disruption with high availability of systems/ channels (to have minimal technical declines);\\n\\nf) Efficient and effective dispute resolution mechanism and handling of customer grievance; and\\n\\ng) Adequate and appropriate review mechanism followed by swift corrective action, in case any one of the above requirements is hampered or having high potential to get hampered.\\n\\nThe Board and Senior Management shall be responsible for implementation of this policy. The policy shall be reviewed periodically, at least on a yearly basis. REs may formulate this policy separately for its different digital products or include the same as part of their overall product policy. Further, the policy document should require that every digital payment product/ services offered addresses the mechanics, clear definition of starting point, critical intermittent stages/ points and end point in the digital payment cycle, security aspects, validations till the digital payment is settled, clear pictorial representation of digital path and exception handling. In addition, signing off of the above requirements, mechanism for carrying out User Acceptance Tests (UAT) in multiple stages before roll out, sign off from multiple stakeholders (post UAT) and data archival requirements shall also be taken in to account. The need for an external assessment of the entire process including the logic, build and security aspects of the application(s) supporting the digital product should be clearly articulated.\\n\\n5 REs shall incorporate appropriate processes into their governance and risk management programs for identifying, analysing, monitoring and managing the specific risks, including compliance risk and fraud risk, associated with the portfolio of digital payment products and services on a continual basis and in a holistic manner. The Board/Senior Management of REs shall have appropriate performance monitoring systems/key performance indicators for assessing whether the product or service offered through digital payment channels meet operational and security norms.\\n\\n6 As part of this process, the REs shall define product-level limits on the level of acceptable security risk, document specific security objectives and performance criteria including quantitative benchmarks for evaluating the success of the security built into the digital payment product or service, periodically compare actual results with projections and qualitative benchmarks to detect and address adverse trends or concerns in a timely manner and modify the business plan/strategy involving the product, when appropriate, based on the security performance of the product or service.\\n\\n7 REs shall have trained resources with necessary expertise to manage the digital payment infrastructure. Wherever the REs are dependent on third party service providers, adequate oversight and controls for monitoring the activities of the third party personnel, in line with RBI guidelines on outsourcing, shall be put in place.\\n\\n8 REs shall conduct risk assessments with regard to the safety and security of digital payment products and associated processes and services as well as suitability and appropriateness of the same vis-a-vis the target users, both prior to establishing the service(s) and regularly thereafter. The risk assessment should take into account –\\n\\na) The technology stack and solutions used;\\n\\nb) Known vulnerabilities at each of the touchpoints of the digital product and the remedial action taken by the entity;\\n\\nc) Dependence on third party service providers and oversight over such providers;\\n\\nd) Risk arising out of integration of digital payment platform with other systems both internal and external to the RE, including core systems and systems of payment systems operators, etc.;\\n\\ne) The customer experience, convenience and technology adoption required to use such products;\\n\\nf) Reconciliation process;\\n\\ng) Interoperability aspects;\\n\\nh) Data storage, security and privacy protection as per extant laws/instructions;\\n\\ni) Operational risk including fraud risk;\\n\\nj) Business continuity and service availability;\\n\\nk) Compliance with extant cyber security requirements; and\\n\\nl) Compatibility aspects.\\n\\nSuch assessment shall cover the surrounding ecosystem as well. The assessment of risks shall address the need to protect and secure payment data1 and evaluate the resilience of systems. The internal Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) exercise shall cover the risks (inherent) & controls vis-à-vis the probability and impact of threats to arrive at residual risk. In such an exercise, it is imperative for REs to maintain database of all systems and applications storing customer data in the payment ecosystem and compliance with applicable PCI standards in each of the systems (notwithstanding mandatory requirements of certification/ standard accreditation).\\n\\n9 REs shall evaluate the risks associated with the chosen technology platforms, application architecture, both on the server and client side. Further, REs should undertake a review of the risk scenarios and existing security measures based on incidents affecting their services, before any major change to the infrastructure or procedures is made or, when, any new threats are identified through risk monitoring activities. Further, unused or unwanted features of the platform should be closely controlled to minimise risk.\\n\\n10 REs shall develop sound internal control systems and take into account the operational risk before offering digital payment products and related services. This would include ensuring that adequate safeguards are in place to protect integrity of data, customer confidentiality and security of data.\\n\\n11 REs shall ensure that the digital payment architecture is robust and scalable, commensurate with the transaction volumes and customer growth. The IT strategy of the RE shall ensure that a robust capacity management plan is in place to meet evolving demand. REs shall also put in place review mechanism of IT/ IT Security architecture and technology platform overhaul on a periodic basis based on Board-approved policy.\\n\\n12 REs shall have necessary capacity, systems and procedures in place to periodically test the backed-up data, application pertaining to digital products to ensure recovery.\\n\\n13 The communication protocol in the digital payment channels (especially over Internet) shall adhere to a secure standard. An appropriate level of encryption and security shall be implemented in the digital payment ecosystem.\\n\\n14 Web applications providing the digital payment products and services should not store sensitive information in HTML hidden fields, cookies, or any other client-side storage to avoid any compromise in the integrity of the data.\\n\\n15 REs shall implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) solution and DDoS mitigation techniques to secure the digital payment products and services offered over Internet.\\n\\n16 The key length (for symmetric/ asymmetric encryption, hashing), algorithms (for encryption, signing, exchange of keys, creation of message digest, random number generators), cipher suites, digital certificates and applicable protocols used in transmission channels, processing of data, authentication purpose, shall be strong, adopting internationally accepted and published standards that are not deprecated/ demonstrated to be insecure/ vulnerable and the configurations involved in implementing such controls are in general, compliant with extant instructions and the law of the land.\\n\\n17 REs shall renew their digital certificates used in digital payment ecosystem well in time.\\n\\n18 The mobile application2 and internet banking application should have effective logging and monitoring capabilities to track user activity, security changes and identify anomalous behaviour and transactions.\\n\\nApplication Security Life Cycle (ASLC)\\n\\n19 REs shall implement multi-tier application architecture, segregating application, database and presentation layer in the digital payment products and services.\\n\\n20 REs shall follow a ‘secure by design’ approach in the development of digital payment products and services. REs shall ensure that digital payment applications are inherently more secure by embedding security within their development lifecycle.\\n\\n21 REs shall explicitly define security objectives (including protection of customer information/data) during (a) requirements gathering, (b) designing, (c) development, (d) testing including source code review, (e) implementation, maintenance & monitoring and (f) decommissioning phases of the digital payment applications.\\n\\n22 REs (including those partnering with other entities to co-brand/co-develop applications) shall adopt and incorporate a threat modelling approach during application lifecycle management into their policies, processes, guidelines and procedures.\\n\\n23 For digital payment applications that are licensed by a third party vendor, REs shall have an escrow arrangement for the source code for ensuring continuity of services in case the vendor defaults or is unable to provide services.\\n\\n24 REs shall conduct security testing including review of source code, Vulnerability Assessment (VA) and Penetration Testing (PT) of their digital payment applications to assure that the application is secure for putting through transactions while preserving confidentiality and integrity of the data that is stored and transmitted. Such testing should invariably cover compliance with various standards like OWASP. If the source code is not owned by the RE, then, in such cases, the RE shall obtain a certificate from the application developer stating that the application is free of known vulnerabilities, malwares and any covert channels in the code. In this context,\\n\\na) The VA shall be conducted at least on a half-yearly basis; PT shall be conducted at least on a yearly basis. In addition, VA/PT shall be conducted as and when any new IT Infrastructure or digital payment application is introduced or when any major change is performed in application or infrastructure;\\n\\nb) Testing related to review of source code/certification shall be conducted/obtained. This shall continue on a yearly basis, if changes/upgrades have been made to the application during the year;\\n\\nc) Testing/Certification should broadly address the objective that the product/version/module(s) functions only in a manner that it is intended to do, is developed as per the best secure design/coding practices and standards, addressing known flaws/threats due to insecure coding; and\\n\\nd) Penal provisions shall be included by the RE into third-party contractual arrangements for any non-compliance by the application provider.\\n\\n25. REs may also run automated VA scanning tools to automatically scan all systems on the network that are critical, public facing or store customer sensitive data on a continuous/more frequent basis.\\n\\n26. REs shall compare the results from earlier vulnerability scans to verify/ ascertain that vulnerabilities are addressed either by patching, implementing a compensating control, or documenting and accepting the residual risk with necessary approval and that there is no recurrence of the known vulnerabilities. The identified vulnerabilities should be fixed in a time-bound manner.\\n\\n27 REs shall ensure that all vulnerability scanning is performed in authenticated mode either with agents running locally on the system to analyse the security configuration or with remote scanners that are given administrative rights on the system being tested.3\\n\\n28 REs shall verify and thoroughly test the functionality (to validate whether the system meets the functional requirements/ specifications) and security controls of payment products and services before its launch/ moving to the production environment.\\n\\n29 REs shall institute a mechanism to actively monitor for the non-genuine/ unauthorised/ malicious applications (with similar name/ features) on popular app-stores and the Web and respond accordingly to bring them down.\\n\\n30 The server at the RE’s end should have adequate checks and balances to ensure that no transaction is carried out through non-genuine/ unauthorised digital payment products/ applications and the authentication process is robust, secure and centralised.\\n\\n31 The security controls for digital payment applications must focus on how these applications handle, store and protect payment data. The APIs for secure data storage and communication have to be implemented and used correctly in order to be effective. REs shall refer to standards such as OWASP-MASVS, OWASP-ASVS and other relevant OWASP standards, security and data protection guidelines in ISO 12812, threat catalogues and guides developed by NIST (including for Bluetooth and LTE security), for application security and other protection measures. Such testing has to necessarily verify for vulnerabilities including, but not limited to OWASP/ OWASP Mobile Top 10, application security guidelines/ requirements developed/ shared by operating system providers/ OEMs.\\n\\n32 REs shall redact/ mask customer information such as account numbers/ card numbers/ other sensitive information when transmitted via SMS/ e-mails.\\n\\n\\nAuthentication Framework\\n\\n33 In view of the proliferation of cyber-attacks and their potential consequences, REs should implement, except where explicitly permitted/relaxed, multi-factor authentication for payments through electronic modes and fund transfers, including cash withdrawals from ATMs/micro-ATMs/business correspondents, through digital payment applications. At least one of the authentication methodologies should be generally dynamic or non-replicable. [e.g., Use of One Time Password, mobile devices (device binding and SIM), biometric/PKI/hardware tokens, EMV chip card (for Card Present Transactions) with server-side verification could be termed either in dynamic or non-replicable methodologies.]\\n\\n34 REs may also adopt adaptive authentication to select the right authentication factors depending on risk assessment, user risk profile and behaviour. Properly designed and implemented multi-factor authentication methods are more reliable and stronger fraud deterrents and are more difficult to compromise. The key objectives of multi-factor authentication are to protect the confidentiality of payment data as well as enhance confidence in digital payment by combating various cyber-attack mechanisms like phishing, keylogging, spyware/malware and other internet-based frauds targeted at REs and their customers. In this regard,\\n\\na) The implementation of appropriate authentication methodologies should be based on an assessment of the risk posed by the RE’s digital payment products and services. The risk should be evaluated in light of the type of customer (e.g., retail/corporate/commercial); the customer transactional requirements/pattern (e.g., bill payment, fund transfer), the sensitivity of customer information and the volume, value of transactions involved.\\n\\nb) Beyond the technology factor, the success of a particular authentication method depends on appropriate policies, procedures, and controls. An effective authentication method should take into consideration customer acceptance, ease of use, reliable performance, scalability to accommodate growth, customer profile, location, transaction, etc., and interoperability with other systems.\\n\\nc) To enhance online processing security, multi-factor authentication and alerts (like SMS, e-mail, etc.) should be applied in respect of all payment transactions (including debits and credits), creation of new account linkages (addition/modification/deletion of beneficiaries), changing account details or revision to fund transfer limits. In devising these security features, REs should take into account their efficacy and differing customer preferences for additional online protection.\\n\\nd) The alerts and OTPs received by the customer for online transactions shall identify the merchant name, wherever applicable, rather than the payment aggregator through which the transaction was effected.\\n\\ne) As an integral part of the multi factor authentication architecture, REs should also implement appropriate measures to minimise exposure to a middleman attack which is more commonly known as a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM), man-in-the browser (MITB) attack or man-in-the application attack. This is to ensure, among other things, that the data in transit is secured and the transactions are authenticated only by genuine/ authorised source/ process.\\n\\nf) An authenticated session, together with its encryption protocol, should remain intact throughout the interaction with the customer. Else, in the event of interference or in case the customer closes the application, the session should be terminated, and the affected transactions resolved or reversed out. The customer should be promptly notified about the status of the transaction by email, SMS or through other means.\\n\\n35 REs should set down the maximum number of failed log-in or authentication attempts after which access to the digital payment product/ service is blocked. They should have a secure procedure in place to re-activate the access to blocked product/ service. The customer shall be notified for failed log-in or authentication attempts.\\n\\nFraud Risk Management\\n\\n36 The REs shall document and implement the configuration aspects for identifying suspicious transactional behaviour in respect of rules, preventive, detective types of controls, mechanism to alert the customers in case of failed authentication, time frame for the same, etc.\\n\\n37 System alerts shall be parameterised and monitored in terms of various applicable parameters. Such parameters, as applicable could be: transaction velocity (e.g., fund transfers, cash withdrawals, payments through electronic modes, adding new beneficiaries, etc.) in a short period, more so in the accounts of customers who’ve never used mobile app/ internet banking/ card ever (depending upon the type of payment channel), high risk merchant category codes (MCC) parameters, counterfeit card parameters (String of Invalid CVV/ PINs indicates an account generation attack), new account parameters (excessive activity on a new account), time zones, geo-locations, IP address origin (in respect of unusual patterns, prohibited zones/ rogue IPs), behavioural biometrics, transaction origination from point of compromise, transactions to mobile wallets/ mobile numbers/ VPAs on whom vishing fraud or other types of fraud is/are registered/ recorded, declined transactions, transactions with no approval code, etc.\\n\\n38 Fraud analysis shall be conducted to identify the reason for fraud occurrence and determine mechanism to prevent such frauds.\\n\\n39 The staff, especially in the fraud control function, shall be educated about frauds and trained in the following skills and areas of expertise:\\n\\na) Fraud control tools and their usage;\\n\\nb) Investigative techniques and procedures;\\n\\nc) Cardholder and merchant education techniques to prevent fraud;\\n\\nd) Scheme/ Card operating regulations;\\n\\ne) Data processing and analysis and liaising or communicating with law enforcement agencies; and\\n\\nf) The requisite skills required to (i) set and update appropriate rules, (ii) monitor the exceptions thrown based on the rules on a continuous basis and take necessary actions promptly, (iii) communicate/ escalate wherever required to appropriate authorities, and (iv) differentiate false positives from the rest.\\n\\n40 REs shall maintain updated contact details of service providers, intermediaries, external agencies and other stakeholders (including other REs) for coordination in incident response. REs shall put in place a mechanism with the stakeholders to update and verify such contact details. REs shall also formulate specific SOPs to handle incidents related to payment ecosystem to mitigate the loss either to the customer or RE.\\n\\nReconciliation Mechanism\\n\\n41 A real time/ near-real time (not later than 24 hours from the time of receipt of settlement file(s)) reconciliation framework for all digital payment transactions between RE and all other stakeholders such as payment system operators, business correspondents, card networks, payment system processors, payment aggregators, payment gateways, third party technology service providers, other participants, etc., shall be put in place for better detection and prevention of suspicious transactions. A mechanism shall be introduced to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of such framework.\\n\\nCustomer Protection, Awareness and Grievance Redressal Mechanism\\n\\n42 REs shall incorporate secure, safe and responsible usage guidelines and training materials for end users within the digital payment applications. They shall also make it mandatory (i.e. not providing any option to circumvent/ avoid the material) for the consumer to go through secure usage guidelines (even in the consumer’s preferred language) while obtaining and recording confirmation during the on-boarding procedure in the first instance and first use after each update of the digital payment application or after major updates to secure and safe usage guidelines.\\n\\n43 REs shall mention/ incorporate a section on the digital payment application clearly specifying the process and procedure (with forms/ contact information, etc.) to lodge consumer grievances. A mechanism to keep this information periodically updated shall also be put in place. The reporting facility on the application shall provide an option for registering a grievance. Customer dispute handling, reporting and resolution procedures, including the expected timelines for the RE's response should be clearly defined.\\n\\n44 REs shall adhere to extant instructions4, updated from time to time, to put in place system/s for online dispute resolution for resolving disputes and grievances of customers pertaining to digital payments.\\n\\n45 REs shall educate customers about the need to maintain the physical and logical security of their devices accessing digital payment products and services including recommending secure/ regular installation of operating system and application updates, downloading applications only from authorised sources, having anti-malware/ anti-virus applications on devices, etc.\\n\\n46 REs shall ensure that its customers are provided information about the risks, benefits and liabilities of using digital payment products and its related services before they subscribe to them. Customers shall also be informed clearly and precisely on their rights, obligations and responsibilities on matters relating to digital payments, and, any problems that may arise from its service unavailability, processing errors and security breaches. The terms and conditions including customer privacy and security policy applying to digital payment products and services shall be readily available to customers within the product. All digital channels are to be offered on express willingness of customers and shall not be bundled without their knowledge.\\n\\n47 Whenever new operating features or functions, particularly those relating to security, integrity and authentication, are introduced to online delivery channels, clear and effective communication followed by sufficient instructions to properly utilise such new features should be provided to the customers.\\n\\n48 REs may continuously create public awareness on the types of threats and attacks used against the consumers while using digital payment products and precautionary measures to safeguard against the same. Customers shall be cautioned against commonly known threats in recent times like phishing, vishing, reverse-phishing, remote access of mobile devices and educated to secure and safeguard their account details, credentials, PIN, card details, devices, etc.\\n\\n49 REs shall provide digital payment products and services, to a customer only at her/his option based on specific written or authenticated electronic requisition along with a positive acknowledgement of the terms and conditions.\\n\\n50 REs should provide a mechanism on their mobile and internet banking application for their customers to, with necessary authentication, identify/mark a transaction as fraudulent for seamless and immediate notification to his RE. On such notification by the customer, the REs may endeavour to build the capability for seamless/instant reporting of fraudulent transactions to the corresponding beneficiary/counterparty’s RE; vice-versa have mechanism to receive such fraudulent transactions reported from other REs. The objective of this mechanism is to accelerate early detection and enable the banking/payment system to trace the transaction trail and mitigate the loss to the defrauded customer at the earliest possible time.\"}\n"

Additionally, terminals at merchants should be validated against the PCI-P2PE program, and acquirers should secure their card payment infrastructure. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) should have logging enabled, be tamper-proof, and access should be controlled through Access Control Lists (ACLs). Security measures for ATMs include implementing BIOS passwords, disabling USB ports, applying the latest patches, and using anti-skimming and whitelisting solutions. Robust surveillance and monitoring of card transactions, especially overseas cash withdrawals, should be in place, with transaction limits set at the card, BIN, and RE levels.
