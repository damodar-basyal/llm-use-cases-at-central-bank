The techniques used by cyber threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and weak links in the interconnected financial ecosystem can be compromised to carry out fraudulent financial transactions, exfiltrate sensitive financial data or disrupt IT systems that support financial services. Hence, each FI should seek to understand their exposure to technology risks and put in place a robust risk management framework to ensure IT and cyber resilience.\\n\\n1.4 The revised MAS Technology Risk Management Guidelines set out technology risk management principles and best practices for the financial sector, to guide FIs in the following:\\n\\n- (a) Establish Sound and Robust Technology Risk Governance and Oversight\\nThe board of directors and senior management at an FI play an integral part in the oversight and management of technology risk. The board of directors and senior management should cultivate a strong risk culture, and ensure the establishment of a sound and robust technology risk management framework.\\n- (b) Maintain Cyber Resilience\\nStrong cyber resilience is critical for sustaining trust and confidence in financial services. FIs should adopt a defence-in-depth approach to strengthening cyber resilience.

It is vital that the FI’s board of directors and senior management ensure effective internal controls and risk management practices are implemented to achieve security, reliability and resilience of its IT operating environment.\\n\\n3.1.2 Both the board of directors and senior management should have members with the knowledge to understand and manage technology risks, which include risks posed by cyber threats.\\n\\n3.1.3 The board of directors and senior management should ensure a Chief Information Officer, Chief Technology Officer or Head of IT, and a Chief Information Security Officer or Head of Information Security1, with the requisite expertise and experience, are appointed. The appointments should be minimally approved by the Chief Executive Officer.\\n\\n3.1.4 The board of directors and senior management should ensure a technology risk management strategy is established and implemented.\\n\\n3.1.5 The board of directors and senior management should ensure key IT decisions are made in accordance with the FI’s risk appetite.\\n\\n3.1.6 Given that technology underpins many of the operations and services offered by an FI, the board of directors and senior management should set the tone from the top and cultivate a strong culture of technology risk awareness and management at all levels of staff within the FI.\\n\\n3.1.7 The board of directors or a committee delegated by it, is responsible for:\\n\\n- ensuring a sound and robust risk management framework is established and maintained to manage technology risks;\\n- ensuring there is a technology risk management function to oversee the technology risk management framework and strategy, as well as to provide an independent view of the technology risks faced by the FI;\\n- giving senior executives, who are responsible for executing the FI’s technology risk management strategy, sufficient authority, resources and access to the board of directors;\\n- approving the risk appetite and risk tolerance statement that articulates the nature and extent of technology risks that the FI is willing and able to assume;\\n- undertaking regular reviews of the technology risk management strategy for continued relevance;\\n- assessing management competencies for managing technology risks; and\\n- ensuring an independent audit function is established to assess the effectiveness of controls, risk management and governance of the FI.\\n\\n3.1.8 Senior management is responsible for:\\n\\n- establishing the technology risk management framework and strategy;\\n- managing technology risks based on the established framework and strategy;\\n- ensuring sound and prudent policies, standards and procedures for managing technology risks are established and maintained, and that standards and procedures are implemented effectively; ensuring the roles and responsibilities of staff in managing technology risks are delineated clearly; and apprising the board of directors of salient and adverse technology risk developments and incidents that are likely to have a major impact on the FI in a timely manner.\\n\\n3.2 Policies, Standards and Procedures\\n\\n3.2.1 The FI should establish policies, standards and procedures and, where appropriate, incorporate industry standards and best practices to manage technology risks and safeguard information assets3 in the FI. The policies, standards and procedures should also be regularly reviewed and updated, taking into consideration the evolving technology and cyber threat landscape.\\n\\n3.2.2 The FI should ensure risks associated with deviations are thoroughly reviewed and assessed. The risk assessment should be approved by senior management. Approved deviations should be reviewed periodically to ensure the residual risks remain at an acceptable level.\\n\\n3.2.3 Compliance processes should be implemented to verify that policies, standards and procedures are adhered to. These include follow-up processes for non-compliance.\\n\\n3.3 Management of Information Assets\\n\\n3.3.1 To have an accurate and complete view of its IT operating environment, the FI should establish information asset management practices that include the following:\\n\\n- identification of information assets that support the FI’s business and delivery of financial services;\\n\\n3.3.1 Classification of an information asset based on its security classification or criticality;\\n\\n3.3.2 The FI should maintain an inventory of all its information assets. The inventory should be reviewed periodically and updated whenever there are changes.\\n\\n3.4 Management of Third Party Services\\n\\n3.4.1 The use of certain third party services by FIs may not always constitute outsourcing. However, as many of these services are provisioned or delivered using IT, or may involve confidential or sensitive customer information being stored or processed electronically by the third party, the FI’s operations and its customers may be adversely impacted if there is a system failure or security breach at the third party.\\n\\n3.4.2 The FI should assess and manage its exposure to technology risks that may affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the IT systems and data at the third party before entering into a contractual agreement or partnership.\\n\\n3.4.3 On an ongoing basis, the FI should ensure the third party employs a high standard of care and diligence in protecting data confidentiality and integrity as well as ensuring system resilience.\\n\\n3.5 Competency and Background Review\\n\\n3.5.1 As the human element plays an important role in managing IT systems and processes in an IT environment, the FI should ensure personnel, including contractors and service providers, have the requisite level of competence and skills to perform the IT functions and manage technology risks.\\n\\n3.5.2 Insider threat, which includes theft of confidential data, sabotage of IT systems and fraud by staff, contractors and service providers, is considered one of the risks to an organisation. A background check on personnel, who has access to the FI’s data and IT systems, should be performed to minimise this risk.\\n\\n3.6 Security Awareness and Training\\n\\n3.6.1 A comprehensive IT security awareness training programme should be established to maintain a high level of awareness among all staff in the FI. The content of the training programme should minimally include information on the prevailing cyber threat landscape and its implications, the FI’s IT security policies and standards, as well as an individual’s responsibility to safeguard information assets. All personnel in the FI should be made aware of the applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines pertaining to the use of, and access to, information assets.\\n\\n3.6.2 The training programme should be conducted at least annually for all staff, contractors and service providers who have access to the FI’s information assets.\\n\\n3.6.3 The board of directors should undergo training to raise their awareness on risks associated with the use of technology and enhance their understanding of technology risk management practices.\\n\\n3.6.4 The training programme should be reviewed periodically to ensure its contents remain current and relevant.

Appropriate governance structures and processes should be established, with well-defined roles, responsibilities, and clear reporting lines across the various organisational functions.\\n\\n4.1.2 Effective risk management practices and internal controls should be instituted to achieve data confidentiality and integrity, system security and reliability, as well as stability and resilience in its IT operating environment.\\n\\n4.1.3 The risk owner, who is accountable for ensuring proper risk treatment measures are implemented and enforced for a specific technology risk, should be identified. The role of the risk owner may be assumed by a function or group of functions within the FI, who is given the authority to manage technology risks.\\n\\n4.1.4 The framework should also encompass the following components:\\n\\n- risk identification – identify threats and vulnerabilities to the FI and information assets;\\n- risk assessment – assess the potential impact and likelihood of threats and vulnerabilities to the FI and information assets;\\n- risk treatment – implement processes and controls to manage technology risks posed to the FI and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets;\\n- risk monitoring, review and reporting – monitor and review technology risks, which include risks that customers are exposed to, changes in business strategy, IT systems, environmental or operating conditions; and report key risks to the board of directors and senior management.\\n\\n4.1.5 As business and IT environments, as well as the cyber threat landscape, tend to evolve over time, the FI should review the adequacy and effectiveness of its risk management framework regularly.\\n\\n4.2 Risk Identification\\n\\n4.2.1 The FI should identify the threats and vulnerabilities applicable to its IT environment, including information assets that are maintained or supported by third party service providers. Examples of security threats that could have a severe impact on the FI and its stakeholders include internal sabotage, malware and data theft.\\n\\n4.3 Risk Assessment\\n\\n4.3.1 The FI should perform an analysis of the potential impact and consequences of the threats and vulnerabilities on the overall business and operations. The FI should take into consideration financial, operational, legal, reputational and regulatory factors in assessing technology risks.\\n\\n4.3.2 To facilitate the prioritisation of technology risks, a set of criteria measuring and determining the likelihood and impact of the risk scenarios should be established.\\n\\n4.4 Risk Treatment\\n\\n4.4.1 The FI should develop and implement risk mitigation and control measures that are consistent with the criticality of the information assets and the level of risk tolerance. The IT control and risk mitigation approach should be subject to regular review and update, taking into account the changing threat landscape and variations in the FI’s risk profile.\\n\\n4.4.2 As there are residual risks from threats and vulnerabilities which cannot be fully eliminated, the FI should assess whether risks have been reduced to an acceptable level after applying the mitigating measures. The criteria and approving authorities for risk acceptance should be clearly defined and it should be commensurate with the FI’s risk tolerance.\\n\\n4.4.3 The FI should take insurance cover for various insurable technology risks to reduce financial impact such as recovery and restitution costs.\\n\\n4.5 Risk Monitoring, Review and Reporting\\n\\n4.5.1 The FI should institute a process for assessing and monitoring the design and operating effectiveness of IT controls against identified risks.\\n\\n4.5.2 A risk register should be maintained to facilitate the monitoring and reporting of technology risks. Significant risks should be monitored closely and reported to the board of directors and senior management. The frequency of monitoring and reporting should be commensurate with the level of risk.\\n\\n4.5.3 To facilitate risk reporting to management, technology risk metrics should be developed to highlight information assets that have the highest risk exposure. In determining the technology risk metrics, the FI should take into account risk events and audit observations, as well as applicable regulatory requirements.'}\n",

An IT project plan should set out the scope of the project, as well as the activities, milestones and the deliverables to be realised at each phase of the project. The roles and responsibilities of staff involved in the project should be clearly defined in the plan.\\n\\n5.1.3 Key documentation in the IT project life cycle, including the feasibility analysis, cost-benefit analysis, business case analysis, project plan, as well as the implementation plan, should be maintained and approved by the relevant business and IT management.\\n\\n5.1.4 As project risks can adversely impact the IT project delivery timeline, budget and quality of the project deliverables, a risk management process should be established to identify, assess, treat and monitor the attendant risks throughout the project life cycle.\\n\\n5.2 Project Steering Committee\\n\\n5.2.1 For large and complex projects that impact the business, a project steering committee consisting of key stakeholders, including business owners and IT, should be formed to provide direction, guidance and oversight to ensure milestones are reached, and deliverables are realised in a timely manner.\\n\\n5.2.2 Risks and issues for large and complex projects, which cannot be resolved at the project management level, should be escalated to the project steering committee and senior management.\\n\\n5.3 System Acquisition\\n\\n5.3.1 The FI should establish standards and procedures for vendor evaluation and selection to ensure the selected vendor is qualified and able to meet its project requirements and deliverables. The level of assessment and due diligence performed should be commensurate with the criticality of the project deliverables to the FI.\\n\\n5.3.2 It is important that the FI assesses the robustness of the vendor’s software development and quality assurance practices, and ensures stringent security practices are in place to safeguard and protect any sensitive data the vendor has access to over the course of the project. Any vendor access to the FI’s IT systems should be controlled and monitored.\\n\\n5.3.3 If a project involves a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution that does not meet the FI’s security requirements, the FI should assess the risks and ensure adequate mitigating controls are implemented to address the risks before the solution is deployed.\\n\\n5.3.4 The FI should assess if a source code escrow agreement should be in place, based on the criticality of the acquired software to the FI’s business, so that the FI can have access to the source code in the event that the vendor is unable to support the FI. Suitable alternatives to replace the software should be identified if an escrow agreement could not be implemented.\\n\\n5.4 System Development Life Cycle and Security-By-Design\\n\\n5.4.1 The FI should establish a framework to manage its system development life cycle (SDLC). The framework should clearly define the processes, procedures and controls in each phase of the life cycle, such as initiation/planning, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing and acceptance. Standards and procedures for the different phases of the SDLC should be maintained.\\n\\n5.4.2 The security-by-design approach refers to building security in every phase of the SDLC in order to minimise system vulnerabilities and reduce the attack surface. The FI should incorporate security specifications in the system design, perform continuous security evaluation, and adhere to security practices throughout the SDLC.\\n\\n5.4.3 Security requirements should minimally cover key control areas such as access control, authentication, authorisation, data integrity and confidentiality, system activity logging, security event tracking and exception handling.\\n\\n5.4.4 The SDLC should, where relevant, involve the IT security function in each phase of the life cycle.\\n\\n5.5 System Requirements Analysis\\n\\n5.5.1 The FI should identify, define and document the functional requirements for the IT system. In addition to functional requirements, key requirements such as system performance, resilience and security controls, should also be established and documented.\\n\\n5.5.2 In establishing the security requirements, the FI should assess the potential threats and risks related to the IT system, and determine the acceptable level of security required to meet its business needs.\\n\\n5.6 System Design and Implementation\\n\\n5.6.1 As part of the design phase, the FI should review the proposed architecture and design of the IT system, including the IT controls to be built into the system, to ensure they meet the defined requirements, before implementation.\\n\\n5.6.2 The FI should verify that system requirements are met by the current system design and implementation. Any changes to, or deviations from, the defined requirements should be endorsed by relevant stakeholders.\\n\\n5.6.3 Relevant domain experts should be engaged to participate in the design review. For example, the security design and architecture of the IT system should be reviewed by IT security specialists or qualified security consultants.\\n\\n5.7 System Testing and Acceptance\\n\\n5.7.1 A methodology for system testing7 should be established. The scope of testing should cover business logic, system function, security controls and system performance under various load and stress conditions. A test plan should be established and approved before testing.\\n\\n5.7 Testing Requirements\\n\\n5.7.2 The FI should trace the requirements during the testing phase, and ensure each requirement is covered by appropriate test cases.\\n\\n5.7.3 The FI should maintain separate physical or logical environments for unit, system integration and user acceptance testing, and restrict access to each environment on a need-to basis.\\n\\n5.7.4 The FI should perform regression testing for changes (e.g. enhancement, rectification, etc.) to an existing IT system to validate that it continues to function properly after the changes have been implemented.\\n\\n5.7.5 Issues identified from testing, including system defects or software bugs, should be properly tracked and addressed. Major issues that could have an adverse impact on the FI’s operations or delivery of service to customers should be reported to the project steering committee and addressed prior to deployment to the production environment.\\n\\n5.7.6 The FI should ensure the results of all testing that was conducted are documented in the test report, and signed off by the relevant stakeholders.\\n\\n5.8 Quality Management\\n\\n5.8.1 During project planning, the FI should define the expected quality attributes and the assessment metrics for the project deliverables based on its quality control standards.\\n\\n5.8.2 Quality assurance should be performed by an independent quality assurance function to ensure project activities and deliverables comply with the FI’s policies, procedures and standards.'}\n",

      "{'title': '# 6 Software Application Development and Management', 'content': '6.1 Secure Coding, Source Code Review and Application Security Testing\\n\\n6.1.1 Software bugs or vulnerabilities are typically targeted and exploited by threat actors to compromise an IT system, and they often occur because of poor software development practices. To minimise the bugs and vulnerabilities in its software, the FI should adopt standards on secure coding, source code review8 and application security testing.\\n\\n6.1.2 The secure coding and source code review standards should cover areas such as secure programming practices, input validation, output encoding, access controls, authentication, cryptographic practices, and error and exception handling.\\n\\n6.1.3 A policy and procedure on the use of third party and open-source software codes should be established to ensure these codes are subject to review and testing before they are integrated into the FI’s software.\\n\\n6.1.4 To facilitate the remediation of vulnerabilities in a timely manner, the FI should keep track of updates and reported vulnerabilities for third party and open-source software codes that are incorporated in the FI’s software.\\n\\n6.1.5 The FI should ensure its software developers are trained or have the necessary knowledge and skills to apply the secure coding and application security standards when developing applications.\\n\\n6.1.6 It is essential for the FI to establish a comprehensive strategy to perform application security validation and testing. The FI may use a mixture of static, dynamic and interactive application security testing methods (refer to Annex A on Application Security Testing) to validate the security of the software application. The software validation and testing rules should be reviewed periodically and kept current.\\n\\n6.1.7 All issues and software defects discovered from the source code review and application security testing should be tracked. Major issues and software defects should be remediated before production deployment.\\n\\n6.2 Agile Software Development\\n\\n6.2.1 Agile software development is based on an iterative and incremental development model to accelerate software development and delivery to respond to business and customer needs. When adopting Agile software development methods, the FI should continue to incorporate the necessary SDLC and security-by-design principles throughout its Agile process.\\n\\n6.2.2 The FI should ensure secure coding, source code review and application security testing standards are applied during Agile software development.\\n\\n6.3 DevSecOps Management\\n\\n6.3.1 DevSecOps is the practice of automating and integrating IT operations, quality assurance and security practices in the software development process. It constitutes continuous integration, continuous delivery and IT security practices for frequent, efficient, reliable and secure development, testing and release of software products. The FI should ensure its DevSecOps activities and processes are aligned with its SDLC framework and IT service management processes (e.g. configuration management, change management, software release management).\\n\\n6.3.2 The FI should implement adequate security measures and enforce segregation of duties for the software development, testing and release functions in its DevSecOps processes.\\n\\n6.4 Application Programming Interface Development\\n\\n6.4.1 Application programming interfaces (APIs) enable various software applications to communicate and interact with each other and exchange data. Open APIs are publicly available APIs that provide developers with programmatic access to a software application or web service. FIs may collaborate with FinTech companies and develop open APIs, which 9APIs are sets of protocols that define how one application interacts with another, usually to facilitate an information exchange.\\n\\n6.4.2 A well-defined vetting process should be implemented for assessing third parties’ suitability in connecting to the FI via APIs, as well as governing third party API access. The vetting criteria should take into account factors such as the third party’s nature of business, cyber security posture, industry reputation and track record.\\n\\n6.4.3 The FI should perform a risk assessment before allowing third parties to connect to its IT systems via APIs, and ensure the implementation for each API is commensurate with the sensitivity and business criticality of the data being exchanged, and the confidentiality and integrity requirements of the data.\\n\\n6.4.4 Security standards for designing and developing secure APIs should be established. The standards should include the measures to protect the API keys or access tokens, which are used to authorise access to APIs to exchange confidential data.

The framework should comprise the governance structure, processes and procedures for IT service management activities including configuration management, technology refresh management, patch management, change management, software release management, incident management and problem management.\\n\\n7.2 Configuration Management\\n\\n7.2.1 Configuration management is the process of maintaining key information (e.g. model, version, specifications, etc.) about the configuration of the hardware and software that makes up each IT system. The FI should implement a configuration management process to maintain accurate information of its hardware and software to have visibility and effective control of its IT systems.\\n\\n7.2.2 The FI should review and verify the configuration information of its hardware and software on a regular basis to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date.\\n\\n7.3 Technology Refresh Management\\n\\n7.3.1 The FI should avoid using outdated and unsupported hardware or software, which could increase its exposure to security and stability risks. The FI should closely monitor the hardware’s or software’s end-of-support (EOS) dates as service providers would typically cease the provision of patches, including those relating to security vulnerabilities that are found after the EOS date.\\n\\n7.3.2 A technology refresh plan for the replacement of hardware and software should be developed before they reach EOS. A risk assessment for hardware and software approaching EOS date should be conducted to evaluate the risks of their continued use, and effective risk mitigation measures should be implemented.\\n\\n7.3.3 The FI should obtain dispensation from its management for the continued use of outdated and unsupported hardware and software. The dispensation should be assigned a validity period that is commensurate with the identified risks and risk mitigation measures. The dispensation should be reviewed periodically to ensure the attendant risks remain at an acceptable level.\\n\\n7.4 Patch Management\\n\\n7.4.1 A patch management process should be established to ensure applicable functional and non-functional patches (e.g. fixes for security vulnerabilities and software bugs) are implemented within a timeframe that is commensurate with the criticality of the patches and the FI’s IT systems.\\n\\n7.4.2 Patches should be tested before they are applied to the FI’s IT systems in the production environment to ensure compatibility with existing IT systems or they do not introduce problems to the IT environment.\\n\\n7.5 Change Management\\n\\n7.5.1 The FI should establish a change management process to ensure changes to information assets are assessed, tested, reviewed and approved before implementation.\\n\\n7.5.2 A risk and impact analysis of the change to an information asset should be conducted before implementing the change. The analysis should cover factors such as security and implications of the change in relation to other information assets.\\n\\n7.5.3 The FI should ensure all changes are adequately tested in the test environment.

The FI may engage external assistance to augment its resources to facilitate and support incident response and recovery. For example, the FI can engage an incident response and security forensic company to support cyber attack investigation, and provide 24 by 7 incident response capability.\\n\\n7.7.3 The incident management framework should minimally cover:\\n\\n- the process and procedure for handling IT incidents, including cyber related incidents;12\\n- maintenance and protection of supporting evidence for the investigation and diagnosis of incidents; and\\n- the roles and responsibilities of staff and external parties involved in recording, analysis, escalation, decision-making, resolution and monitoring of incidents.\\n\\n7.7.4 The FI should configure system events or alerts to provide an early indication of issues that may affect its IT systems’ performance and security. System events or alerts should be actively monitored so that prompt measures can be taken to address the issues early.\\n\\n7.7.5 In some situations, a major incident may develop unfavourably into a crisis. The FI should regularly apprise its senior management of the status of major incidents so that decisions to mitigate the impact of the crisis can be made in a timely manner, such as activation of IT disaster recovery.\\n\\n7.7.6 A communications plan that covers the process and procedures to apprise customers of impact on services, and to handle media or public queries should be maintained.

The frequency of VA should be commensurate with the criticality of the IT system and the security risk to which it is exposed.\\n\\n13.1.2 When performing VA, the scope should minimally include vulnerability discovery, identification of weak security configurations, and open network ports, as well as application vulnerabilities. For web-based systems, the scope of VA should include checks on common web-based vulnerabilities.\\n\\n13.2 Penetration Testing\\n\\n13.2.1 The FI should carry out penetration testing (PT) to obtain an in-depth evaluation of its cyber security defences. A combination of blackbox and greybox testing should be conducted for online financial services.\\n\\n13.2.2 A bug bounty programme is another means by which an FI could discover vulnerabilities in their IT systems by inviting and incentivising ethical or “white hat” hackers to conduct PT on their systems. The FI may consider conducting a bug bounty programme to test the security of its IT infrastructure to complement its PT.\\n\\n13.2.3 To obtain a more accurate assessment of the robustness of the FI’s security measures, PT should be conducted on the production environment. Proper safeguards should be implemented when PT is conducted on the production environment.\\n\\n13.2.4 The frequency of PT should be determined based on factors such as system criticality and the system’s exposure to cyber risks. For systems that are directly accessible from the Internet, the FI is expected to conduct PT to validate the adequacy of the security controls at least once annually or whenever these systems undergo major changes or updates.\\n\\n The 2 common types of penetration testing are:\\n\\n- a) blackbox testing, which refers to testing without any prior knowledge of the environment except for the IP address ranges and known URLs; and\\n- b) greybox testing, which refers to testing with credentials.

This can be achieved through data encryption and digital signatures.\\n\\n14.1.3 Adequate measures should also be taken to minimise exposure of the FI’s online financial services to common attack vectors such as code injection attack, cross-site scripting, man-in-the-middle attack (MITMA),35 domain name system (DNS) hijacking,36 distributed denial of service (DDoS), malware and spoofing attacks.\\n\\n14.1.4 An FI offering online financial services access via a mobile device should be aware of the risks unique to mobile applications. Specific measures aimed at addressing the risks of mobile applications should be put in place. Refer to Annex C for guidance on Mobile Application Security.\\n\\n14.1.5 The FI should only make available mobile applications or software to customers through official mobile application stores, or other secure delivery channels.\\n\\n- Examples of online financial services include online banking, mobile banking, phone banking, online trading, mobile/digital wallets and payments, and financial and payment services offered using account and transaction APIs, etc.\\n\\n- In a MITMA attack, an interloper is able to read, insert and modify messages between two communicating parties without either one knowing that the communication between them has been compromised. Possible attack points for MITMA could be within customer computers, internal networks, information service providers, web servers or anywhere in the Internet along the path between the customer and the FI’s server.\\n\\n- A cyber attack technique where an attacker uses malware to change the IP address of a resource linked to a specific domain name (e.g. a particular website), and redirect victims to a rogue domain name (e.g. phishing or fake website).\\n\\n14.1.6 The FI should actively monitor for phishing campaigns targeting the FI and its customers. Immediate action should be taken to report phishing attempts to service providers to facilitate the removal of malicious content. The FI should alert its customers of such campaigns and advise them of security measures to adopt to protect against phishing.\\n\\n14.1.7 Rooted or jailbroken mobile devices, which are more susceptible to malware and may have more security vulnerabilities, should be disallowed from accessing the FI’s mobile applications to perform financial transactions unless the application has been secured within a sandbox or container that insulates the application from tampering and interception by malware.\\n\\n14.2 Customer Authentication and Transaction Signing\\n\\n14.2.1 Multi-factor authentication should be deployed at login for online financial services to secure the customer authentication process. Multi-factor authentication can be based on two or more of the following factors, i.e. what you know (e.g. personal identification number or password), what you have (e.g. one-time password (OTP) generator) and who you are (e.g. biometrics).\\n\\n14.2.2 End-to-end encryption should be implemented for the transmission of customer passwords so that they are not exposed at any intermediate nodes between the customer mobile application or browser and the IT system where passwords are verified. To safeguard the confidentiality of customer passwords, the passwords should only be verified in a hardened or tamper resistant system.\\n\\n14.2.3 The FI should implement transaction-signing (e.g. digital signatures) for authorising high-risk activities to protect the integrity of customer accounts’ data and transaction details. High-risk activities include changes to sensitive customer data (e.g. customer office and home address, email and telephone contact details), registration of third party payee details, high value funds transfers and revision of funds transfer limits.\\n\\n14.2.4 Besides login and transaction-signing for high-risk activities, the FI may implement appropriate risk-based or adaptive authentication that presents customers with authentication options that are commensurate with the risk level of the transaction and sensitivity of the data.\\n\\n14.2.5 When implementing time-based OTPs, the FI should establish a validity period that is as short as practicable to lower the risk of a stolen OTP being used for fraudulent transactions.\\n\\n14.2.6 Where biometric technologies37 and customer passwords are used for customer authentication, the FI should ensure the biometrics-related data and authentication credentials are encrypted in storage and during transmission.\\n\\n14.2.7 The performance of the biometric solution, based on false acceptance rate (FAR)38 and false rejection rate (FRR)39, should be calibrated to be commensurate with the risk associated with the online activity.\\n\\n14.2.8 A soft token is a software-based two-factor authentication mechanism installed on a general-purpose device.40 Appropriate measures, such as verifying the identity of the customer, detecting and blocking rooted or jailbroken devices, and performing device binding,41 should be implemented during soft token provisioning.\\n\\n14.2.9 The FI should ensure the authenticated session, together with its encryption protocol, remains intact throughout the interaction with the customer. Measures to detect and terminate hijacked sessions should be implemented. To reduce the risk of an attacker from maintaining a hijacked session indefinitely, an online session should be automatically terminated after inactivity for a pre-defined time.\\n\\n14.2.10 Where alternate controls and processes (e.g. maker-checker function) are implemented for corporate or institutional customers to authorise transactions, the FI should perform a security risk assessment of controls or processes to ensure they are commensurate with the risk of the activities that are being carried out.\\n\\n14.2.11 To safeguard the confidentiality of authentication credentials, such as biometric templates and passwords, the FI should store these credentials in a form that is resistant.\\n\\n- Biometric recognition technologies could be based on face, iris or palm images, voice patterns, etc.\\n\\n- FAR represents the instance a biometric identification solution positively verifies an unauthorised person.\\n\\n- FRR represents the instance a biometric identification solution fails to verify an authorised person correctly.\\n\\n- Examples: a desktop computer, laptop, or mobile device like a smartphone or tablet.\\n\\n- Device binding is a technique to link an authorised user to his registered device and ensure accountability.\\n\\n14.3 Fraud Monitoring\\n\\n14.3.1 The FI should implement real-time fraud monitoring systems to identify and block suspicious or fraudulent online transactions.42\\n\\n14.3.2 A process should be established to investigate suspicious transactions or payments and to ensure issues are adequately and promptly addressed.\\n\\n14.3.3 The FI should notify customers of suspicious activities or funds transfers above a threshold that is defined by the FI or customers. The notification should contain meaningful information such as type of transaction and payment amount, as well as instructions to report suspicious activities or unauthorised transactions.\\n\\n14.4 Customer Education and Communication\\n\\n14.4.1 Customers should be informed of the security best practices that they should adopt when using online financial services. This includes the measures to take to secure their electronic devices that are used to access online financial services.\\n\\n14.4.2 The FI should alert its customers on a timely basis to new cyber threats so that they can take precautionary measures.\\n\\n14.4.3 The FI should advise their customers on the means to detect unauthorised transactions and to report promptly security issues, suspicious activities or suspected fraud to the FI.\\n\\n- For example, transactions or payments exhibiting behaviour which deviates significantly from a customer’s usual usage behaviours, or abnormal system activities (e.g. multiple sessions using an identical customer account originating from different geographical locations within a short time span).'}\n",

Cloud computing is also seen as a means to accommodate business requirements for high availability and redundancy, including business continuity and disaster recovery.\\n\\nDefinition:\\n\\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) define cloud computing as follows:\\n\\n“Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models and four deployment models.”\\n\\nDeployment Models:\\n\\nDeployment models are defined to distinguish between different models of ownership and distribution of the resources used to deliver cloud services. Cloud environments may be deployed over a private infrastructure, public infrastructure or a combination of both. The most common deployment models as per NIST include:\\n\\n- Private Cloud: The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.\\n- Community Cloud: The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.\\n- Public Cloud: The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.\\n- Hybrid Cloud: The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).\\n\\n\\nService Models:\\n\\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) define three types of cloud service model which is as follows:\\n\\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS):\\n\\nThe capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider‘s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user specific application configuration settings.\\n\\nPlatform as a Service (PaaS):\\n\\nThe capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.\\n\\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS):\\n\\nThe capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).\\n\\n7.1 Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC)\\n\\n7.1.1 There shall be a clear strategy for using cloud computing services which is consistent and aligned with organization‘s overall IT strategy, architecture, risk appetite, level of governance, management comfort and its ability to monitor the cloud service provider.\\n\\n7.1.2 The Organization shall follow all the controls of the ‘Guideline on Cloud Computing‘ formulated by Bangladesh Bank.'}\n",

      "{'title': '# Chapter 14: Emerging Technology Management', 'content': \"The banking and financial industry in the world is geared up for a transformational space and has gained a significant momentum through embracing futuristic technologies such as applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Analytics, Distributed Ledger Technology (e.g. blockchain), Robotics, Cloud computing, etc. Every technology has a double-edged sword and banks need to carry out due diligence with regard to new technologies since they can potentially introduce additional risk exposures or unintended consequences.\\n\\n14.1 Artificial Intelligence (AI)\\n\\nAI helps banks to develop new products according to customer preferences. And, responding to technological developments, many banks are leveraging AI in the front end to smooth customer identification and authentication, mimic live employees through chatbots and voice assistants through voice bots, deepen customer relationships, and provide personalized insights and recommendations.\\n\\n14.2 AI Security Risks\\n\\nAI is a relatively new force in business, thus, AI enablers, or the AI itself could create new risks. As well as AI has significant challenges for the organizations, from reputational damage and revenue losses to regulatory backlash, criminal investigation, and diminished public trust. AI system may have scripting errors, bad algorithm, data difficulties or lapses in data management, technology and process troubles/issues, security snags, inadequate human–machine interactions and may also deliver biased results and underrepresented data population may be used to train the AI model.\\n\\n14.3 AI Security Controls\\n\\nThe use of AI carries a risk of compliance with protocols related to data privacy, fairness, behavioral risk, personal-identity risk and cyber-security. Thus, appropriate balance between innovation and risk must be enforced by putting in place controls for managing the unimaginable.\\n\\n14.3.1 Rigorous safeguards shall be ensured so that disgruntled employees or external foes are not able to corrupt algorithms or use an AI application in malfeasant ways.\\n\\n14.3.2 Human judgment shall be applied to prove faulty system results or biased results or models misbehavior.\\n\\n14.3.3 AI models shall be transparent and for improved customer service.\\n\\n14.3.4 The use of AI system must be continuously monitored & operated by qualified human resources.\\n\\n14.3.5 Sensitive information like Personally Identifiable Information (PII) may be hidden among anonymized data. Thus, AI system shall be designed in such a way that sensitive information is difficult to reveal (if any).\\n\\n14.3.6 Employees must be well-trained on working knowledge of AI systems, shall have awareness on related risks and mitigation actions.\\n\\n14.3.7 The Organization shall conduct scenario planning and create a fallback plan to handle disaster situation in case AI model performance drifts, data inputs shift unexpectedly or sudden changes, such as a natural disaster occur in the external environment.\\n\\n\\n14.4 Machine Learning (ML)\\n\\nMachine learning for financial forecasting can be applied to many administrative, operational, and client areas of the banking industry. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can provide unprecedented levels of automation, either by taking over the tasks of human experts, or by enhancing their performance while assisting them with routine and repetitive tasks.\\n\\nOrganizations are getting benefitted from machine learning and some common uses are Facial recognition and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.\\n\\n14.5 ML Security Risks\\n\\nMachine learning systems open new avenues for attacks that don’t exist in conventional procedural programs. One of these is the evasion or adversarial attack, in which a foe attempts to inject inputs to ML models that are intentionally meant to trigger mistakes. The data may look okay to humans, but subtle variances can cause ML algorithms to go wildly off track.\\n\\nSuch attacks may occur at inference time by exploiting the model’s internal information, typically in one of two ways like white box attack and black box attack. The most common machine learning attacks are Evasion attacks, Poisoning attacks, Model Inversion attacks, Online System Manipulation, Transfer learning attack and Privacy Attacks.\\n\\n14.6 ML Security Controls\\n\\nFollowing best practices can help fight back the attacks on machine learning systems:\\n\\n14.6.1 It must be ensured that completely trusted third party or vendor has been involved to train model or provide samples for preparing it.\\n\\n14.6.2 A mechanism or plan shall be developed to inspect the training data for any contamination. This should be done if training is done internally.\\n\\n14.6.3 Ground-truth test shall be performed on the model after every training session. Significant changes in classifications from the original collection will show poisoning.\\n\\n14.6.4 The model shall be compressed, so it becomes a smooth decision surface resulting in less room for an attacker to manipulate it.\\n\\n14.6.5 Model shall be trained with all the possible accusatory examples an assailant can use.\\n\\n14.6.6 Algorithm shall not be biased.\\n\\n\\n14.7 Data/Analytics (DA)\\n\\nToday, success is achieved by driving intelligent customer engagement based on a data-driven understanding of the business. Technology and digitization have transformed the financial sector by enabling them with real-time actionable insights to make informed decisions, creating competitive advantages and elevating consumer experience. This also allows banks to share potential products, upsells, cross-sells and strategic planning with customers. With AI-backed models, the ability to transform the banking experiences of customers is truly exponential.\\n\\n\\n14.8 DA/Security Risks\\n\\nData Tampering, Eavesdropping, Data Theft, Falsifying User Identities, Password related Threats, Unauthorized Access to Tables and Columns or Data Rows and Lack of Accountability are some loopholes of data analytics.\\n\\n14.9 DA/Security Controls\\n\\n14.9.1 Analyst shall be well versed in all stages of Data Analytics and Data Analysis tools and techniques.\\n\\n14.9.2 Data Analysts shall monitor the activities related to the systems and user behavior, especially potentially suspicious pattern or behavioral trends, in order to keep threats away.\\n\\n14.9.3 Tracking of User Access shall be established. In a regular interval, Access should be reviewed.\\n\\n14.9.4 Sensitive Files shall be quarantined.\\n\\n14.9.5 Behavior-based permissions shall be established.\\n\\n14.9.6 Data sanitization shall be in place.\\n\\n14.9.7 Data Analysts shall report analysis results in a clear and understandable form.\\n\\n\\n14.10 Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\\n\\nThe volume of unstructured data that banks have to process is growing exponentially with the rise of the digital economy. These are not just banking transaction data, but also other behavior that could allow banks to improve and innovate the customer experience. With a combination of various technologies that enable cognitive and robotic process automation, the Organization can understand customer action and make a judgment at a higher speed, scale and quality. Additionally, smart virtual assistants today are handling transactions, providing important information and helping customers.\\n\\nRobotic Process Automation is improving the user experience by allowing bots to handle repetitive tasks without human intervention to provide better customer service.\\n\\n14.11 RPA Security Controls\\n\\n14.11.1 Accountability for Bot actions must be ensured.\\n\\n14.11.2 Bot operators and Bot identities must be differentiated.\\n\\n14.11.3 RPA implementation can lead to an increase in account privileges & fraud. Thus, RPA access shall be strictly restricted to what each bot needs to conduct the assigned task.\\n\\n14.11.4 RPA tool shall provide complete, system-generated logs without any gaps.\\n\\n14.11.5 Integrity of the RPA logs shall be protected to aid proper investigation or review in case of RPA security fails or incident happens.\\n\\n14.11.6 Periodically review and test shall be conducted on RPA scripts with a special focus on business logic vulnerabilities.\\n\\n\\n14.12 Virtual Meetings & Video Conferencing\\n\\nConfidential or sensitive Information used during meetings or conference and in meeting rooms available to various groups must be secured and inadvertent disclosure to unauthorized individuals must be ensured.\\n\\n\\n14.13 Virtual Meetings & Video Conferencing Security Controls\\n\\n14.13.1 The meeting convener must ensure that any sensitive information on paper or other materials is cleared from the meeting room on completion of the meeting.\\n\\n14.13.2 All attendees must be made aware by the meeting convener or presenter about their duties on handling of CONFIDENTIAL or SENSITIVE information, which discussed in group meetings.\\n\\n14.13.3 Encrypted video conferencing facilities must be used for sessions if any CONFIDENTIAL or SENSITIVE information are discussed in the meeting.\\n\\n\\n14.14 Social Media/Instant Messaging Banking\\n\\nIn recent years, business use of social media has exploded. Many Banks or FOs are using WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, Viber, Skype and other social media platforms to interact with customers and prospects and to market their products and services. For Banks or FOs, the opportunities these platforms provide also come with significant risks. Social media activity can have a negative impact on The Organization's reputation. The Social media or instant messaging platform must be used for banking so as to maintain suitable information security and protect The Organization's information assets. Uncontrolled and unregulated proliferation of the organization‘s information may pose significant risk for the organization.\\n\\n14.15 Social Media Banking Security Controls\\n\\n14.15.1 There must have specific terms & conditions for social media banking.\\n14.15.2 The Organization must have verified account/profile in an individual social media platform.\\n14.15.3 Customer must be verified every time through personal/secret questions and/or multifactor authentication/face recognition.\\n14.15.4 Social media account of the organization never be directly connected with the core/primary systems.\\n14.15.5 The device from where the official social media account is operated must be dedicated for social media banking and only inevitable software/application will be installed in that device.\\n14.15.6 Activities and security risks of social media and digital channels must be closely monitored. Continuously watch for phishing links, fraudulent accounts, scams and more shall be ensured.\\n14.15.7 Sensitive information, customer information shall not be shared through social media account. Employees shall be well trained on what information should or should not be posted or visible to the public.\\n14.15.8 Malicious URLs and IPs found on social media must be blacklisted/blocked and malicious posts and profiles must be taken down immediately.\\n14.15.9 Communication/chat history should be safely preserved.\\n\\n\\n14.16 Distributed Ledger Technology\\n\\nDistributed ledger or Blockchain technology provides a decentralized, transparent and immutable list of transactions. The Blockchain technology and its applications have been grown rapidly in finance, supply chain, digital identity, energy, healthcare, real estate and government.\\n\\nThe most Blockchain security risks are private key, malware vulnerability, Wallet Attacks, Time jacking Attacks, over 50% Attack, Race attack, Selfish Mining and smart contract.\\n\\n14.16.1 The Organization shall define and establish a business process and/or procedure in relation of the Blockchain solution and its use cases.\\n\\n14.16.2 The Organization shall perform the risk management strategy in relation with Blockchain-based solution including but not limited to performing risk assessment and treatment along with on-going monitoring and review.\\n\\n14.16.3 The Organization shall establish and agree on a process to define the data type that will be stored on the Blockchain along with the data’s ownership responsibilities.\\n\\n14.16.4 The Organization shall define, design, plan, and implement an Identity Access Management (IAM) solution for the granted Blockchain-based service in line with the user on-boarding and off-boarding processes.\\n\\n14.16.5 The Organization shall establish and agree on the architecture and procedure for Hardware Security Module (HSM) implementation for securing Blockchain identity keys.\\n\\n14.16.6 The Organization shall protect and secure the internal and external communications of the Blockchain-based solution using a highly secure channel(s).\\n\\n14.16.7 The Organization should define, develop, implement the security incident and event management process and/or procedure about the Blockchain-based solution including preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery.\"}\n"

       "\n",
       "Penetration testing should be conducted at least annually for critical information systems and those in the De-Militarized Zone (DMZ) with customer interfaces. For non-critical systems, the frequency and necessity of penetration testing should be determined based on a risk-based approach. These tests should be performed by independent and trained information security experts or auditors. In post-implementation scenarios, penetration testing should ideally be done in the production environment, but if conducted in a test environment, it must closely resemble the production environment. Any deviations should be documented and approved by the Information Security Committee (ISC). Additionally, identified vulnerabilities should be addressed promptly to prevent recurrence.\n",

       "\n",
       "Penetration testing at BB is addressed through a methodology that includes several key provisions:\n",
       "\n",
       "- The methodology is based on industry-accepted penetration testing approaches, such as NIST SP800-115.\n",
       "- It covers critical systems and includes testing from both inside and outside the network.\n",
       "- It includes a review and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities experienced in the last 12 months.\n",
       "- It specifies the retention of penetration testing results and remediation results.\n",
       "- Penetration testing is performed at least annually and after any significant infrastructure or application upgrade or modification."
