Many financial institutions (FIs) are riding the wave of digitalisation to increase operational efficiency and to deliver better services to consumers.\\n\\n1.2 Digital transformation in the financial sector can be broadly characterised by the adoption of new technology and the use of existing technology in innovative ways to achieve greater automation and enrich financial service offerings.\\n\\n1.3 While digital transformation brings significant benefits to the financial ecosystem, it also increases FIs’ exposure to a range of technology risks, including cyber risk. The techniques used by cyber threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and weak links in the interconnected financial ecosystem can be compromised to carry out fraudulent financial transactions, exfiltrate sensitive financial data or disrupt IT systems that support financial services. Hence, each FI should seek to understand their exposure to technology risks and put in place a robust risk management framework to ensure IT and cyber resilience.\\n\\n1.4 The revised MAS Technology Risk Management Guidelines set out technology risk management principles and best practices for the financial sector, to guide FIs in the following:\\n\\n- (a) Establish Sound and Robust Technology Risk Governance and Oversight\\nThe board of directors and senior management at an FI play an integral part in the oversight and management of technology risk. The board of directors and senior management should cultivate a strong risk culture, and ensure the establishment of a sound and robust technology risk management framework.\\n- (b) Maintain Cyber Resilience\\nStrong cyber resilience is critical for sustaining trust and confidence in financial services. FIs should adopt a defence-in-depth approach to strengthening cyber resilience. It is also important that FIs establish and continuously improve their IT processes and controls to preserve confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and IT systems.'}\n",
