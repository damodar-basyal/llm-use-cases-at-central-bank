In view of the proliferation of cyber-attacks and their potential consequences, REs \nshould implement , except where explicitly permitted/ relaxed,  multi-factor \nauthentication for payments through electronic modes and fund transfers, including \ncash withdrawals from ATMs/ micro- ATMs/ business correspondents,  through \ndigital payment applications. At least one of the authentication methodolog ies \nshould be generally dynamic or non-replicable. [e.g., Use of One Time Password, \nmobile devices (device binding  and SIM), biometric/ PKI/ hardware tokens, EMV \nchip card (for Card Present Transactions)  with server -side verification could be \ntermed either in dynamic or non-replicable methodologies.]. \n34. REs may also adopt adaptive authentication to select the right authentication factors \ndepending on risk assessment, user risk profile and behaviour.  Properly designed \nand implemented multi -factor authentication methods are more reliable and \nstronger fraud deterrents and are more difficult to compromise. The key objectives \nof multi-factor authentication are to protect the confidentiality of payment data as \nwell as enhance confidence in digital payment  by combating various cyber -attack \nmechanisms like phishing, keylogging, spyware/ malware and other internet-based \nfrauds targeted at REs and their customers. In this regard,  \na) The implementation of appropriate authentication methodologies should be \nbased on an assessment of the risk posed by the RE\u2019s digital payment products \nand services. The risk should be evaluated in light of the type of customer (e.g., \nretail/ corporate/ commercial); the customer transactional requirements/ pattern \n(e.g., bill payment, fund transfer), the sensitivity of customer information and \nthe volume, value of transactions involved. \n \nb) Beyond the technology factor, the success of a particular authentication method \ndepends on appropriate policies, procedures, and controls. An effective \nauthentication method should take into consideration customer acceptance, \nease of use, reliable performance, scalability to accommodate growth, \ncustomer profile, location, transaction, etc ., and interoperability with other \nsystems. \n \nc) To enhance online processing security, multi factor authentication and alerts \n(like SMS, e-mail, etc.) should be applied in respect of all payment transactions \n(including debits and credits) , creation of new account linkages (addition/ \nmodification/ deletion of beneficiaries), changing account details or revision to \nfund transfer limits. In devising these security features, REs should take into \naccount their efficacy and differing customer preferences for additional online \nprotection. \n \nd) The alerts  and OTPs received by the customer for online transactions shall \nidentify the merchant  name, wherever applicable, rather than the payment \naggregator through which the transaction was effected.

This is to \nensure, among other things, that the data in transit is secured and the \ntransactions are authenticated only by genuine/ authorised source/ process.  \n \nf) An authenticated session, together with its encryption protocol, should remain \nintact throughout the interaction with the customer. Else, in the event of \ninterference or in case the customer closes the application, the session should \nbe terminated , and the af fected transactions resolved or reversed out. The \ncustomer should be promptly notified about the status of the transaction by \nemail, SMS or through other means. \n \n35.

The security controls to be implemented at HSM are: \na) The HSMs should have logging enabled, the logs must themselves be tamper \nproof;  \nb) HSM can become a single point of failure. This needs to be mitigated by \n\u2018clustering\u2019 for high availability and ensure secure backups;  \nc) Access to the HSM should be controlled through Access Control Lists (ACLs);  \nd) Separate ACLs should be maintained for each individual application to ensure \napplication level isolation;  \ne) All access to HSM should be managed and monitored using a robust Privileged \nIdentity and Access Management solution; \nf) Decryption and validation of keys, PIN should be done at HSM; \n                                                           \n6 PCI Secure Software Standard, a PCI standard within PCI Software Security Framework (SSF) will replace PA-DSS as the \nprimary standard for securing payment software in 2022.
